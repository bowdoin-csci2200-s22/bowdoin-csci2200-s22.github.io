## Announcements (Spring '22)
*** 

1/18:  

Hi everyone, Welcome to Algorithms! We'll be meeting 3 x week,  MWF at 11:40am. 

The first week of classes all 3 meetings will be via __zoom__.   

Below is my zoom room.  This is the zoom link we'll use for all zoom meetings throughout the semester (e.g. classes, office hours).

From this point all announcements and communication will be on Slack.
