## Announcements (Spring '22)
*** 

1/18:  

Hi everyone, Welcome to Algorithms! We'll be meeting 3 x week,  MWF at 11:40am. 

The first week of classes all 3 meetings will be via __zoom__.   

This is the zoom link we'll use for all zoom meetings throughout the semester (e.g. classes, office hours).  I have disabled the waiting room, but you need to authenticate with your bowdoin account in order to join.
